title = "I am not a software engineer"

+++
Since around 1968 (the "software crisis") people tried to fix software development through trying a more engineering like process for development. 

But it wasn't very successful, projects still didn't went by plan, failing to met budgets or timelines. And doing more planning and applying more engineering methods made it not better. As it turned out engineering is not a useful model for software development, I would even call it harmful. 

Beginning in the 1990s alternative approaches emerged, after 2001 they went under the term ["agile"](http://agilemanifesto.org/).

I truly believe that agile (in the meaning of the original manifesto) is a right step towards a better understanding of software development and software engineering is not.

So I struggle every time I read "software engineer" as a job title or job description. I'm not a engineer: I am simply a software developer and it has nothing to do with building a house.
